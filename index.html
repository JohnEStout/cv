  <!-- a little about me here
-->
  <p>I am currently studying web development. I am currently going through the
    <em><strong>The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp</strong></em>
    by Angela Yu on
    <strong>
      <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">&#xfb;demy.com</a></strong>.

    I have an interest in Cyber Security and learning Python as well.
  </p>
  <p>I would love to find an <strong>internship</strong> with someone while
    I am in the <strong>student</strong> phase of my new career.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am just an old oilfield hand, looking to make a career change.
